A collection of some useful Adobe Illustrator scripts.

MultiExporter.js
---------------

Over the last year or so, I’ve cobbled together a couple Illustrator
scripts that export multiple artboards in an Illustrator document as
PNG files, and export multiple layers as PNG files. I’d been meaning
to merge them into one script, but had never quite gotten around to it
until Khoi tweeted that he was looking for a script that did just
that, but to PDF format.

So, a couple train rides later, I’ve finally combined the two scripts
into a single one with a couple more added features: you can choose to
export as PDFs in addition to PNGs, and you can also export the
product of artboards and layers.

Preflight.js

Checks a document for overprinting white type, CMYK black type and
alerts you if your document is in RGB color mode. Not the most
intelligent script, but does the trick most of the time.
